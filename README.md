# Open source platform for analysing and sharing worm behaviour data.

## Tierpsy Tracker
[Tierpsy Tracker](https://github.com/ver228/tierpsy-tracker) is a multi-worm tracker  Full resolution videos are available as HDF5 files, which allows losslessly compressed video frames to be stored in the same file as  experiment metadata. We have also developed an HDF5 video reader that allows video playback with adjustable speed and zoom, which is especially important for high resolution multi-worm tracking data. The viewer allows manual review of segmentation accuracy by toggling worm outline and skeleton overlays during playback.

## Worm tracker Commons Object Notation (WCON).
[WCON](https://github.com/openworm/tracker-commons) file format provides a simple way to share C. elegans tracking data between labs and analysis packages. WCON is a subset of the widely supported [JSON](http://json.org/) format to store tracking data as text that is both human and machine readable. Optimized WCON readers are available for Python, MATLAB, Scala, and R.
